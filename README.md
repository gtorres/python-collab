# A website

Nobody knows what this repository does yet, but it'll be awesome.

## Goal

There are a lot of technologies that can be involved in fulfilling the needs of even the simplest product and getting it out to an environment where it can be interacted with by the target audience, be it an internal stakeholder or an external end user. The goal of this repo is to work through some of those concepts, utilizing technologies about which we may not be as knowledgeable. We'll not only create some code, probably in the form of TypeScript and React, but we'll also write automation for build and deployment, IaC, and tests.
